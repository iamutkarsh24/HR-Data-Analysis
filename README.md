The HR analytics project aimed to uncover key factors influencing employee retention, satisfaction, and overall workforce dynamics. By leveraging a 
comprehensive dataset that included various employee attributes, the project sought to identify patterns and trends that could inform strategic HR decisions., including:

which employees leave an organization over a specific period. It is typically expressed as 
a percentage. 

- **Age Group:**: An age group is a category of people who fall within a specific age range. Age groups are 
often used in demographic studies, marketing, health research, and other fields to 
analyze and compare behaviors, preferences, and outcomes among different 
segments of the population.

- **Business Travel:**: Business travel refers to the activities associated with traveling to different locations for 
professional purposes.

- **Department:**: In a company, a department is a specialized division responsible for a specific area of
